This script uses JHU Covid19 data and US Census Bureau data to create bar graphs and disease, death, and population totals for states in the United States.

To call the function:
	covidplot("State")

**Update**
Another script is available to show Covid19 data for two states simultaneously. The first script was modified and the new script is called covid_statesx2.py.
To call the function:
	covidplot("State", "State")
